# Anemia Prediction (In progress)
## 1. Overview
This project implements a web application for predicting anemia risk using machine learning. The app allows users to input their hematological parameters and receive an anemia diagnosis based on a trained predictive model. It leverages Streamlit for an interactive interface and uses advanced machine learning techniques to assess anemia status.

Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on manual interpretation of hematological parameters, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Our research aims to bridge this gap by developing a sophisticated machine learning approach that:

- Provides rapid, data-driven anemia risk assessment
- Uncovers subtle, non-linear relationships in hematological data
- Offers personalized insights based on comprehensive statistical analysis
- Democratizes access to advanced diagnostic tools

Built upon groundbreaking research by [Mojumdar et al. (2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11699093/), this project represents a convergence of clinical expertise and cutting-edge data science, transforming how we approach anemia diagnosis and early intervention.

## 4. Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimnguyen2002/Anemia-Prediction.git
cd Anemia-Prediction
```

2. **Install the required packages:**
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://yourlocalhost` to access the application.

## 5. Usage

### Data Exploration

To run the exploratory data analysis:

```bash
python src/data_exploration.py
```

This will generate visualizations and statistics about the dataset in the `output/figures` directory.

### Model Training

To train and evaluate machine learning models:

```bash
python src/model_training.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Perform feature selection
- Train multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate their performance
- Save the best model to `models/anemia_prediction_model.pkl`

### Web Application

To run the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the application on your local machine, which you can access via your web browser.
